                    especially in everyday life. The only exceptions are the "lucky ones" who have their own farm and
                    ducks. But this does not mean that you cannot please yourself and your loved ones with this
                    delicious, and most importantly, quite simple dish to prepare. Moreover, if you want to find a
                    quality duck carcass, it’s easy. In different countries of the world, baked duck with oranges is
                    popular and has its own flavors. This is achieved by using various spices and marinating methods. We
                    will not delve into each of them, but simply consider the most popular and proven recipe. We also
                    clarify that in cooking a lot depends on who exactly cooks. As practice shows, even having the same
                    set of products.

                <div class="service-description-text">Ingredients may vary depending on your wishes and preferences. Now
                    the recipe for cooking duck with oranges. And the first is the preparation of the bird.
                    If it is already gutted and cleaned of feathers - great. If not, then proceed to this "dirty work".
                    Be sure to remove the tail, excess skin around the neck and excess fat, especially if it does not
                    appeal to its appearance. It is also worth getting rid of the outermost bones on the wings,
                    otherwise, during baking, they will turn into charred, bad-smelling coals, which will nullify all
                    your efforts. Now we mix the ingredients prepared in advance for our marinade in a deep container
                    and immerse the duck there. Lubricate it well on all sides and leave it in the refrigerator for at
                    least a night, and even better for a day.

                <div class="service-description-text">Don't forget to flip the duck occasionally. This will allow the
                    meat to soak as evenly as possible.
                    In order for the duck baked with oranges to be guaranteed to come out juicy, put it in a deep baking
                    sheet with the breast up. Cut the oranges and put them in the carcass. We send it to the oven
                    already preheated to the desired temperature. It's about 190 degrees. After 50-60 minutes, when the
                    juice begins to stand out, do not forget to water the duck periodically. Do not rely on the recipe
                    for the time of readiness of the dish. The exact cooking time depends on the size of the bird. On
                    average, it takes 2-2.5 hours. After your dish is ready, you need to prepare a delicious glaze. Mix
                    the ingredients and put on a slow fire. Let the resulting syrup boil to a thick syrup.

                    Now you know how to cook duck with oranges, which means you have the opportunity to show your guests
                    your culinary skills and give a festive atmosphere to any day. After all, it is the aroma of a duck
                    with a light fragrance of citrus that evokes in our head associations with a holiday, fun, and gives
                    a feeling of magic!
                    By the way, fresh oranges and some other fruits will serve as a decoration for the dish. Unobtrusive
                    sweetness combined with the juicy taste of meat will definitely appeal to even the most demanding
                    gourmets.

                    practice shows, some housewives, not wanting to be creative, serve the most banal mashed potatoes
                    with such a luxurious duck.
                    But a vegetable salad would be much more appropriate. For example, a tomato salad, for which in one
                    salad bowl you need to mix all kinds of tomatoes that you only have, add chopped garlic and basil to
                    them. As a dressing, you can use any vegetable oil to taste or mayonnaise - it's a matter of
                    preference. Such a light salad will be a chic addition to a soft and juicy duck. Dishes will turn
                    out not only satisfying, but also useful.

                    stuff the duck with two peeled and chopped oranges and a cinnamon stick. Fasten with toothpicks. We

                <p class="about-description-text">Lamb loin, ribs, neck, shoulder blade and ham are perfect for
                    barbecue. Many also use fat tail, stringing it between pieces of meat. It is believed that fat makes
                    the barbecue juicier. It is best to cook from young lamb. Skewers from old meat will turn out
                    tough.</p>
